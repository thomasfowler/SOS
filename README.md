Science of Sales
================

TODO:

1. In order to see what opportunities need to be captured for a brand, we need to provide a
    screen that shows all the current brands that do not yet have an opportunity logged for
    the current fiscal. It must obviously be filtered for the current user. In this way, a user
    can quickly see what brands they still need to plan for this year
2. Related to the item abve, we should also show the user what the historic performance was
    for that *brand*... That is to say, rolled up for the brands
3. Performance history needs to link, I think, to the brand, not the opportunity...? Maybe?
4. Add / edit opportunity needs some form validation. Disable the drop downs until correct things selected etc
5. For opportunities, we probably need to track who created the opportunity, and who last updated it


### Notes from meeting

If not account manager, on opportunities show the rep

Add opportunity - if agency is null, then you can only choose a brand that is not associated with an agency

Create opportunity - if sales director or bu manager, you can create an opp for another user
